Developed an interface for real-time plotting of 3D well trajectory profiles, providing comprehensive insights into drilling patterns.
The solution enables visualization of multiple well trajectories within a single reservoir, offering a clear view of their spatial distribution. 
Integrated an intelligent alert system that flags trajectories approaching within 20 feet to enhance operational safety.
