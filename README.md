 • Designed an interface for real-time plotting of 3D well trajectory profiles, offering comprehensive insights into drilling patterns.
 • Designed and implemented functionality to plot multiple well trajectories within a single reservoir and effectively visualize their spatial distribution.
 • Integrated an alert system that flags well trajectories approaching within 20 ft, enhancing safety in drilling operations.
